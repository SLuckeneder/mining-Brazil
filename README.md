# Brazilian mining impacts - A Bayesian Spatial Durbin Model

This repository contains the R scripts and data to reproduce results from "Transient economic benefit and persistent forest loss: regional impacts of mining in Brazil". 

## Usage

All scripts related to data compilation (`00_compile_data.R` and herein sourced `01_*.R`) automatically download and process raw data (see respective `01_*.R` scripts). Alternatively, users can move directly to the models (`10_run_spatial_models.R` and herein sourced `11_lndetPaceBarry.R` and `12_run_*.R`), as ready-to-use dataset required for running the scripts is also provided in this GitHub repository.

`10_run_spatial_models.R` runs 6 Bayesian Spatial Durbin Models estimating municipality-level mining impacts on per capita GDP, relative and absolute forest loss for yearly and pooled (pre-2010 and post-2010) effects. MCMC draws of estimated parameters are stored as Rdata in `./data/intermediary/MCMC_draws`. Related direct, indirect and total impact estimates of the spatial models are stored in `./data/impact_estimates/draws` and summarised as csv files in `./data/impact_estimates/summaries`. `11_lndetPaceBarry.R` provides a function to approximate the log-determinant of positive-definite spatial projection matrices of the form $(I - \rho W)$ as proposed by Barry and Pace (1999) and `13_geweke_statistics.R` shows convergence of the samplers using diagnostics proposed by Geweke (1992).

`20_figures_main.R` (sourcing `21_figure_1.R`, `22_figure_2.R`, `23_figure_3.R`, `24_figure_4.R` and `25_figure_5.R`) generates the respective main text figures, saved as PNG files in `./figures/main_text`.

`30_run_models_SI` runs models presented in the supplementary information.

`40_figures_SI.R` generates the respective figures for the supplementary information, saved as PNG files in `./figures/SI`.

`50_tables_SI_latex.R` generates LaTeX code for the tables shown in the supplementary information.
